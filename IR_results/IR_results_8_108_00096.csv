0,5284337,I have created a database program where I am able to add the data and retrieve it as well but I am stuck as to how do I increase the rows dynamically. If I give 2 rows or 4 rows in a go then I am able to do that like    Now If want to add these data as many times as user clicks add more button. Then is overwriting the same row again and again. How do I insert in the database so that it creates a new row next to the previous row. And I retrieve it too with the row ID. Any help appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

If I put this using a 2 for loop, as per my understanding 256 rows would be added to the database which is not my requirement. I want all the 256 values in one column of a single row in database. I am new to android. Please suggest."
