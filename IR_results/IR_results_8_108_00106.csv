                           thanks."
1,5178613,"How can we execute pre-database sqlite statements in Android? I have created my own database layer. This layer will create the database and even the queries. It has a method that will create the table by providing the table name, column names and column types as parameters to it and the table will be generated without writing the full length query. So, to implement this I have created a test application and inside the onCreate method I have used my method that is going to generate the CREATE TABLE query and execute it. But as the database is not yet created it's throwing a NullPointerException.   So how can I fix this exception?"
0,4388459,"Hey I want to create a database with an AUTO_INCREMENT column. But I don't know how to parse the value in the method insert. I just don't know what to parse to an AUTO_INCREMENT argument, and I parsed 1 where should be auto_increment, but I know its not that I should parse. Here is the CallDatHelper.java class where I declare the method insert, and the method that creates the database. And here is where I call the insert method parsing the data I want to insert."
0,4234030,"My app uses two databases (separate files). To handle these databases I have created two Helper classes which extend SQLiteOpenHelper, one for each database. I am now going to add a third database and wonder whether I need to create yet another Helper class (and if I used a 4th and a 5th database would I need even more Helper classes), or can I use the same Helper class for multiple databases? The problem that I see with trying to use just one Helper class is that I can't see how to pass the name of the individual database files to the Helper. At present the name of the database is hard-coded as a Static field of each of the Helper classes, but if I had only one Helper class I would need to be able to pass the different names in to the Constructor when creating the separate Helper objects; the problem is that the SQLiteOpenHelper Constructor seems to be called by Android with just one parameter: the Context."
