0,2756375,"I have an android app that periodically, say once a week downloads content from a server in XML. The content is used by the app, different Acitivities use different parts of the content. My question is a design one, should I save the data in SQlite or just keep it as an XML file, which one would be faster to read?  The app can only use one content piece at a time, which means subsequent XML content downloads replace the old one."

And this Activity have only one scrollbar include all text &amp; gridview. for it, using scrollview. I wrote xml and class like attached using ScrollView to have only one 
scroll.
