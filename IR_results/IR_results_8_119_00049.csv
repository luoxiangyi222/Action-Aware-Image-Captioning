My preference xml file is called, ""settings.xml"".

Then when I go back from the settings menu to my main screen - all is well - for life! ...then each var above is assigned the proper default value.

By the way, as you can see, ""List1"" is the android:key within a file called settings.xml in my res/xml folder."
