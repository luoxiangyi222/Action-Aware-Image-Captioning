label,id,text
1,3113586,"I'm trying to test a date picker scenario on android. I have the date picker which comes up when I click a text view(with id say v) which has a label on it along with a hint ""Enter Date"". The problem is that I'm trying to simulate this clicking of the text view and then selecting of the date from the date picker dialog. I cannot find an method call/option in Solo to get hold of the text view (ex:with id say x).
I've been trying to figure it out for the past three days. Can anyone suggest me a way to go about it?. Thanks  Prasanna"

0,3713433,I have a listview populated by a text file hosted on my website that is parsed and made into seperate list items. Each list item sends the user to a new activity to view more information on that item. My question is - how do I go about tracking the following data about my application..
0,4610907,"I have a button in my activity, when you click the button an if statement is ran against its text label; Firstly, if I hit the home button and go back to the desktop and then click back onto my app the view has reset its self; if I press the button and leave it in a state where the text of the button is ""secondtext"", when I return to my app it says ""firsttext"", how can I stop the view of my app refreshing its self like this? Secondly, under my XML layout I have defined the buttons text; android:text=""firsttext""
But this won't actually match my if statement above, under onCreate of this app I have: BTN_CONNECT.setText(""Connect"");
But visually the text of the button is exactly the same, why won't it match? Thanks for reading :)"
