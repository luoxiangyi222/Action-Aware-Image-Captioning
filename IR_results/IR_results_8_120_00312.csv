0,5248319,"I have a an application that has 2 parts. Each of these run as different processes. The problem is that both of them share a database. And I frequently get database locked error, both when the service tries to write something and the UI is reading data. Also vice versa.
How do go about this?  How do I get the two processes share the database.
Any cues would be greatly appreciated."
0,5634781,"I have ListView with 2 different types of layout: one with image and another without image. I try to do something like this. I override getView of BaseAdapter: My ViewHolders classes:  It works without the second part, but crashes when it going to  in part when item.get(""image_location"").equals("""") != true with java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException. Any ideas how can I fix that?"
0,4909530,"I am attempting to make an android application with a pre-populated database. When learning about how to go about this, I came across this article  , which basically takes an existing sqlite database and streams it into the correct location on the android device. The data I had was dealt with in ruby, so I grabbed the sqlite gem, and created a database like so.  When I go into the database, both the one made from the ruby script, and the one from using adb and examining the database on the emulator, I get this for the schema. However, when I pull the data back out in my application, getString can't deal with the name, specifically, this block gets into the exception clause, and prints the name successfully within that block I can deal with that, but it seems like I shouldn't have to do that. Any one else encountered this, or know what I'm doing wrong?"
0,4897466,"I'm really a beginner, I'm reading many different Android books as I would like to learn how to develop my own app. The app I've in mind is going to access to a remote database in order the write and read data. I would like to ask your advise about how this is usually done, best practices. I want to learnt about databases as I actually know so little (just how to make some sql queries and procedures) and I would like to focus my learning towards Android integration. Thanks a lot."
0,2511371,"I have a really strange problem. I need to build custom sqlite3 database engine under Android OS, but I also want to use database provider implementation. Unfortunately when examining sources of Android 1.6 I noticed that it's not so easy. Many classes including android.database.; packages use original provider, also many other parts of framework use android.database.sqlite.; packages directly, wich ofcourse make this abstraction a bit confusing and unnesesary. But going to my question. If there is any way that I could extend database interfaces to use custom implmentation of sqlite (or any other database)?"
