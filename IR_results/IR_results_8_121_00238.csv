0,3838561,"I am trying to create my first widget. To make a experiment I am trying to visualize a Toast every update but it does not appear. This is my manifest:   And in the onUpdate method of my AppWidgetProvider class I inserted: It seems that it doesn't update, should do it every 5 seconds! Any idea?"
0,2837775,"I want to be able to start a short video on an incoming phone call. The video will loop until the call is answered. I've loaded the video onto the emulator sdcard then created the appropriate level avd with a path to the sdcard.iso file on disk. Since I'm running on a Mac OS x snow leopard I am able to confirm the contents of the sdcard. All testing has be done on the Android emulator. In a separate project TestVideo I created an activity that just launches the video from the sdcard. That works as expected. Then I created another project TestIncoming that creates an activity that creates a PhoneStateListener that overrides the onCallStateChanged(int state, String incomingNumber) method. In the onCallStateChanged() method I check if state == TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_RINGING. If true I create an Intent that starts the video. I'm actually using the code from the TestVideo project above. Here is the code snippet. The PhoneStateListener is added to the TelephonyManager.listen() method like so, Here is the part I'm unclear on, the manifest. What I've tried is the following: I've run the debugger after setting breakpoints in the IncomingVideoDemo activity where the PhoneStateListener is created and none of the breakpoints are hit. Any insights into solving this problem is greatly appreciated. Thanks."
0,3655152,"i created a database with 6 columns and i have a create and update method in my class that takes 6 parameters/arguments which represent these columns. my problem is that, anytime i try to update or create the database without using all 6 arguments (setting some to null), i get an  error ""constraint failed"". this is most particular with the update method.  any ideas how i can get around this? because sometimes i don't want to fill all columns. I have removed the ""text not null"" constraint when creating the database.  Thank you."

1) FOA PD (ProgressDialog) can be created only from Activity, doesn't it? Please provide an useful example if it is really not.
2) If a PD should be created in separate thread could it be created and showed if it's thread doesn't do anything at all? I mean something like this (assuming mProgressDialog is a property of the class): As I understand the thread dies immediately after executing run() cause there is nothing to do and so PD doesn't show. It should have some processing code or at least an empty cycle with some manageable condition
3) if PD should be created in the main thread should it be created only at the end of OnCreate() method or in the body of some method called/caught(by some Listener) started  in OnCreate() method?
4) PD by itself doesn't suspend any thread while displaying, does it? So the code continues executing after the show() method . I mean the show() by itself doesn't suspend/pause the thread cause I guessed it does."
0,5342672,"Hi I have a problem with my app. When I create a new project for Android 2.2 or lower my app works fine and my toast shows on screen but when I create a new project for 2.3 or 2.3.3 with the same code the toast does not appear at all. Also I have added the Textview update with in the main OnCreate thread but still me textview does not update. I need to solve the toast issue mainly though.
thanks"
