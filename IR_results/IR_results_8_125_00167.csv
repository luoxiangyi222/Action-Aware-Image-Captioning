0,4155630,"sorry for my english ;-P! I'm writing an app that shows in google maps pipes and valves(lines and points). For that i've two classes. One extends from ItemizedOverlay, and i add to map overlay one for each category of valve, and each one can have more than one item. The second extends from Overlay, and in the draw method y draw the line with the method drawline of the canvas. The problem i've is that the lines are drawn over the ItemizedOverlay items, no matter the order i add them to the mapView.getOverlays(). I want the lines on the bottom of all overlays. is there a way to do that. Thanks very much."

0,4707049,"I have a button class thats created from within the onSurfaceCreated method in my glSurfaceView; It takes gl as one of its parameters so it can properly draw. Im having an issue passing gl to an overlay class, which looks like a pin in the google maps app. If i call makeOverlay() in my button's constructor it draws perfectly, if i call it anywhere else all i get is a white square. They are all on the same drawing thread. Anyone know what im missing? Thanks."
