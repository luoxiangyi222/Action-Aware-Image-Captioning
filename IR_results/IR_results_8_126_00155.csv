0,3780001,"I am creating my SQLite database for my App at runtime if it does not exist and insert rows if it does. Since it is supposed to be created at runtime and I have implemented it by creating a subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper and overriding the onCreate() method -  ""Do I need to put anything in the /assets folder of my project?"" I am not using any Content Provider ""Do I need to add any tags in the AndroidManifest.xml?"" Here is what I have done. The strings have been defined properly and I do not get any runtime exceptions. Implementation of the SQLiteOpenHelper subclass. } Here is where I create an instance of the MyDB subclass of the SQLiteOpenHelper. Everything runs and when I go to the sqlite shell and write the following query select * from table_name - it just tells me no such record exist. I set breakpoints and it seems after the getReadableDatabase() is called the @Override OnCreate() method is never executed which is where I execute the Create table SQLs. I have tried getWritableDatabase()
as well.  I dont understand why the tables are not being created. If anyone can help that would be awesome. Thanks. Query Text String#1 private static final String USERAUTH_TABLE_CREATE =

ProgressBar doesn't have a method to set the style (I want a small
ProgressBar). The constructor can take an AttributeSet, however, it is an
interface and requires me to implement a set of functions. Is there a way
to set the ProgressBar to a small style? (I can't use XML to create
ProgressBar.)"

0,3655152,"i created a database with 6 columns and i have a create and update method in my class that takes 6 parameters/arguments which represent these columns. my problem is that, anytime i try to update or create the database without using all 6 arguments (setting some to null), i get an  error ""constraint failed"". this is most particular with the update method.  any ideas how i can get around this? because sometimes i don't want to fill all columns. I have removed the ""text not null"" constraint when creating the database.  Thank you."
