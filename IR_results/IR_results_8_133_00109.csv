I've added it on onCreate() method, but when I need to use some methods it says database not open, and then I've removed from onCreate() and it says close() was not explicity called. so where should I close, could it be inside each method of the class?? here is the code: And this is my Activity:"

0,4004294,"In my activity I need a ProgressDialog with a horizontal progress bar to visualise the progress of a background task. To make the activity care for the dialog e.g. in case of screen rotation, I would like to use a managed dialog created in onCreateDialog. The problem is that I need to update the progress bar of the dialog after it has been created and therefor I need a reference to the managed progress dialog: Does anyone know how to retrieve a reference to a dialog created by onCreateDialog? At the moment I am storing a reference to the dialog created in onCreateDialog, but that my fail with a InvalidArgumentException in the onFinished() method after the screen has been rotated (and the activity has been recreated): I would have expected something like a getDialog(int) method in the Activity class to get a reference to a managed dialog, but this doesn't seem to exist. Any ideas?"

I know that this question has been asked many times in this forum itself. But I am not able to get a working solution out of any one of them. My problem is that I need to create a list view with images. The content is static. Eg: Lets say i need to display 5 rows of data and I have 5 images to go with these rows. All i need to do is to display them in a list format! Simple right?? Thanks in advance!"
