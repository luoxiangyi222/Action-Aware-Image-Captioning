0,4483650,"My Android App works fine, except the end sequence. Its a game and at the end the screen shows the score: Next I want the GUI to slowdown for a few seconds so the user has time to take in the information. Maybe 2 or 3 secs is fine. Bear in mind, I'm new to thread programming. All this is done on the UI thread, I have no other threads running.
Next I put in a final splash screen ending: where AnView is my own extension of View. All in all it runs great. Problem is the thread sleeps for 3 seconds without showing my final score. I don't know why. I don't know why it doesn't show my final score before sleeping. It actually goes blank, indicating that it removed all views and then slept."

I have googled a whole day,still,I can not find a solution.So, I post my question here,hope to get some hit. I want to add some blank area at the end of a webview in android, I try to set the bottom padding of webview,however, it doesn't work. I know the layout of webview is absoluteLayout,which is deprecated, and I tried get the whole length of webview,and add a view at the end, I try to use getContentHeight(), however, the height is not quite correct,
it is not end of webview,maybe because of picture or something else, I do not know. So,my question is,is there anyway to achieve my original goal, which is add some blank area at the end of a webview? Thanks in advance!"
0,3753498,"Please kindly have a look at this. I am trying to set an alarm for a specific time and date. It does not seem to be working and i don't really know why.  just to let you know, it works if i replace the cal.getTimeInMillis() with System.CurrentTimeInMillis() in the alarms.set() methods.  But thats obviously what i don't want. Thanks    "
