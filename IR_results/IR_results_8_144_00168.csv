0,3537854,"I'm starting to use RelativeLayout more and more but there are some things I keep running into.  Say I have a status textview that I want top and center. Then I have a bunch of other objects below it like images and a table layout.  I want the stuff below the status text view to respect the status textview's personal space and not draw themselves right on top of it.  But what I'm seeing is that in a relativelayout, everything piles up on eachother unless I use alignment such as android:layout_below and android:layout_above.  Is there an attribute that I can add to the status textview to make it so other objects don't want to draw right on top of it? Or do I have to keep using the alignment tags on everything and align things away from it?  Thanks!"
