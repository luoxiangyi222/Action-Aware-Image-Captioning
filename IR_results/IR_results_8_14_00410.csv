0,4162424,"I got a question about Activity.finish(). In my Android code, there are 4 activities (A, B, C, D). The starting activity A calls startActivityForResult(intent, reqCode) to start activity B. B starts C, and then finish(), not waiting for result. C does exactly the same as B, starts D and then finish(). D will return some result, by setResult(resultCode). When my code runs and activity D returns some result, A will catch a RESULT_CANCELED on onActivityResult(), even if RESULT_OK is returned in D. I guess the RESULT_CANCELED is from activity B, which has been terminated before D returns a result, rather than from D.  But, my question is, why activity A catch RESULT_CANCELED after D returns some result, rather than immediately after B is terminated? And, what should I do to make A catch results from D? Do I have to keep B and C alive, to pass results from D to A?"
0,5063601,"Android question: I am currently in Activity A and inside of A I start Activity B using startActivityForResult. At different points in B I can set different values as the result using setResult. While I am still inside of Activity B, is there any way for me to check what will be the current result that will be sent back to Activity A? (Or do I have to keep track of this information myself?) Thanks."
1,2579850,"In my application I have several activities, the main screen has 4 buttons that each start a different activity. So one of them is a search activity, once it searches it shows you a result activity. This result activity can be reached from other activities, so in general something like this: Now, if I have reached this result activity and press back once or twice, and after that press the Home key it will show the Home screen. But if I want to get back to my application by holding the Home button and clicking on my app it will always go back to the Result activity, no matter which activity was the last one I was using. And if I press again back it will take me back to the Home screen. If I try it again it will take me again to the Result activity. The only way to avoid this is to start the application by clicking on the app's icon. And this takes me to the last activity I was using and it remembers the state so if I press back again it doesn't take me to the Home screen, instead to the activity before it. To illustrate this: Another thing that happens is that if I press the Home button while on the Result activity, and start the app by clicking the icon, it will take me to the activity prior the the Result one. Why is this happening? Any workarounds?"
0,4325735,"I have 2 activities : When activity A start downloading, the app enter a loading phase. When it's complete, activity B starts, so I have a transition between the views of A &amp; B. Then B requires also a loading phase. I have loading - transition - loading - result which doesn't look nice at all. I would like to have loading - transition - result where the loadings of both activities are grouped. So my question is : is there a way to start the activity but to delay the transition ?"
0,3658285,"As we know, startActivityForResult() used to get a result for a task from parent activity. Here when we click the setResult(). It returns the result to the parent Activity.  Child Activity means it should maintain the persistent state. That is when the users clicks a button on the child activity. It do not finishes that activity and show the Parent Activity. And again i may go to the child activity from parent activity. If the child does not exists it starts a new child activity else it should show the existing child activity with persistent content.  Edit: Simply said, my parent Activity starts a new Child Activity. Now both Activities should be alive. How to call the Parent Activity without finishing the child Activity(in other words, How to BringtoFront the parent Activity)? For this scenario,  Is that possible in Android? Any Idea?"
