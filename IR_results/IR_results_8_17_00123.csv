Something like: I want to show a custom LinearLayout that allows me to set some semi-complex preferences. What is the best way to go about this? Thanks,

0,2520021,"I'm using listpreference in my android app and getting my key values and all is well and works good (now that you guys have helped me) BUT - when my listpreference menus popup, they only contain a cancel button. Let's say the user is choosing between red, blue, and green. When the listpreference dialog first pops-up, the dialog only shows a cancel button. Because of that, the dialog disappears as soon as the user selects their choice. I would like it so that when the user chooses their setting, they see the radio button get highlighted and then they go ahead and click the ok button...but I don't have an ok button and can't figure out why. Any help would be awesome...al "
