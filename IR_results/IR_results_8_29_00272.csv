0,4699781,I am thinking of starting with android development.  What are the equivalents of IBActions and IBOutlets in android?  Is it as easy as Interface Builder to setup connections to code? Is it quick to learn the basics of android development if one knows java?
0,4903458,"One of my colleagues was trying to load my APK from an internal web site and then opening it from the installer.  The application crashes at launch time with the following stack and referring to an activity that I do not have.  I believe it is because I (temporarily) have two entry points for my application from the manifest, therefore, a resolver (chooser) is needed. Is this true? Here is a piece of the manifest.  Notice the Welcome and the Settings activities.  Both have intent filters for Launcher with Main and that is what needs to be ""resolved"" before starting the activity.  Apparently other installers just grab one (at random, first, etc.)?"
