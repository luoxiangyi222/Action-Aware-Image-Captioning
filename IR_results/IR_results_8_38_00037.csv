0,5395635,"There is something I really don't understand with the Android Widget API. I wrote a widget with a configuration Activity, and each time I install the application with adb, WidgetProvider.onUpdate() is called even if the widget isn't displayed. And also sometimes with multiple appWidgetIds, and also when the configuration Activity is started. In the onUpdate method I checked the value of appWidgetManager.getAppWidgetIds(), and it returns 0 items. I don't understand because I though : As I experiment all those 3 dots are false... Can someone help me ? Thanks in advance"
0,2416782,"I'm going to create widget which needs to update its content every minute (it shows time-related data). However, there is no need to update widget if it is currently invisible, which means: What is the best way to update only visible widget every minute - without waking up device nor doing unnecessary computations? After widget becomes visible, small lag before update is acceptable."
0,4288539,"I draw a lot of lines rectangles each frame in my game - it's a recreation of an old school handheld electronic game. The ones that had crude dot matrix display for the main game and custom images for text or some images. I have 20x20 big ""pixels"" on a virtual dot matrix screen, I also draw some 7-segment displays on the screen and some other things. According to TraceView, most of time is spent at drawLine and drawRectangle methods, because there is simply too much of them. I draw each 'pixel' of the dot matrix display, and each segment of 7-segment displays in every frame. An optimization came to my mind, that I would repaint only those pixels/segments which changed, so I have saved the previous state of pixels/segments and tried to repaint only changed ones. Basically it's a crude invalidation. The behavior I was expecting was that the Canvas would stay as it was after the last frame finished painting, and I would only repaint necessary stuff. Alas, my Canvas was flickering to black and every once in a while when state of my screen changed, only pixels of dot matrix display/segments flickered on for a frame. And I made sure that I didn't Clear my canvas. I'm drawing on a Canvas inside a SurfaceView, updating Thread, as is described in Lunar Lander Android sample. In the Lunar Lander sample, they repaint everything in each frame. Maybe I could render everything to a Bitmap on the first frame, then update that Bitmap on every other frame? Which technique should I use for my paint() method?"
