0,1982452,"I'd like to send an sms message. If the text is too long, I split it into multiple messages. I'm trying to put some extra info into the ""sent"" intent to know which part has been sent, and when all the parts are complete: The message is sent, and I catch the intent when each part is sent - but the intent always has the same data in it. For example, ""partIndex"" is always zero, even though for the second message, it should be one. Seems like the same intent just keeps getting thrown to my broadcast receiver. What's the right way to do this? Thanks"
0,3188867,"Trying to grok intents and actions in android and looking through the documentation.
But one thing I keep seeing is an intent filter with multiple actions defined. Like this, from the above link: But, if you call that activity, how does it choose which action is chosen? For that matter, that linked to example has multiple activities that all contain the same actions, ""android.intent.action.VIEW"" for example.  When calling this with something like content://com.google.provider.NotePad/notes how does it even know which activity to use?"
0,1970187,"My Problem is that I need to send messages with a delay of 1 second. The handler then initiates some action, you're getting the picture.  There are nevertheless some conditions in which the already sent message should be deleted ( before the second elapsed ) to prevent the handler from doing anything. I couldn't figure out how to do this ( or if it's even possible ), so If anyone of you has a clue, please let me know.. "
0,3338277,Anyone knows how to build errors like that shown in Androffice screenshots on AppBrain ([    I think that I saw errors like that before. Is that built in Android SDK?
1,3374323,"This part of my code checks to see that when the user clicks on a contact, the contact actually has a phone number, otherwise a message is displayed and nothing else is done. I am confused as to where my null pointer exception is coming from.... my error is ""failure delivering result RESULTINFO"" , and it also says it's a nullpointer exception error in this line: earlier in the code, I declare stringNumber to initialize to null. I thought that since the first part of the if evals to false, it wouldn't even check the second part (which is where I think the error is coming from)."
