74,8_58/00307.jpg,going to change anything but what we can do is we can now add chang,need to do font cuz i set up a bitmap we can just kind of our on draw <end
75,8_58/00309.jpg,basically this on draw is going to be looping so we can say changin,then what we can do this below our green ball that is we can do for is we can do 20 so hopefull
76,8_58/00322.jpg,basically this on draw is going to be looping so we can say changin,the assets or whatever method so we're gonna say here we're gonna say this it'll do this before we can do 20 s

93,8_70/00104.jpg,know the size of our canvas so we're going to add like what 10 10 pixel,setting this for paint we're gonna say my here that's uh forgot to have our font to the actual crap so we're gonn
94,8_70/00109.jpg,know the size of our canvas so we're going to add like what 10 10 pixel,setting this will be the actual xml or again i'm sorry we can refer to the actual object or before so we're gonn

413,8_144/00255.jpg,you what we can do to get around that but first let's do that because w,we did again we need to do in <end
414,8_144/00256.jpg,grab the canvas size because again the canvas takes up the whole width an,i'll create <end
415,8_144/00258.jpg,grab the canvas size because again the canvas takes up the whole width an,i'll deal right <end
416,8_144/00260.jpg,can hit dot and then we can say get width right here and that's goin,can do that one other thing and we're gonna say canvas dot paste paint and <end
417,8_144/00261.jpg,return the value of the pixels of the whole width that's available to u,one other quick thing that we can do for is we can do like that context it's not not before and then w
418,8_144/00263.jpg,let's put that in parentheses that whole thing and all right we don't have t,start green in our assets from asset <end
419,8_144/00265.jpg,let's put that in parentheses that whole thing and all right we don't have t,the assets from that we set up to the assets from asset <end

422,8_144/00268.jpg,that but this is just kind of easier for me to look at because again this i,release so we're gonna say <end
423,8_144/00271.jpg,to set it at the top of the screen and for the paint we're just going t,our bitmap variable and then we are asset <end
424,8_144/00272.jpg,application we're going to actually have you know our bitmap on there i,asset can do <end
425,8_144/00273.jpg,application we're going to actually have you know our bitmap on there i,we're gonna give us our new yet or not not going to do now <end
426,8_144/00275.jpg,with it but let's just kind of go over everything we've done s,to open up and basically set up there we run our <end
427,8_144/00280.jpg,or instance of that object and we want to pass in the context so then w,we're gonna use a uh thanks yet as you can be like <end

429,8_144/00283.jpg,over to so it's basically going to get to this line and be like okay let',by a little bit more one and we can use a common trick that one or not maybe one more <end
430,8_144/00285.jpg,what that has to offer and it's going to go int,what we're going to give you know if you guys then just import this there and it's going to open up so w

1156,8_120/00312.jpg,we're getting passed in so what we're gonna do is we're gonna sa,all of our database and for the most part and all we have to again we're going to learn is equal to whateve
1157,8_120/00314.jpg,underscore row id and then we're gonna say plus equals in quotations an,going to update entry and the second one last tutorial again this is <end
1158,8_120/00317.jpg,plus rl that we're getting passed in and then everything else is gonna be se,for the command pretty simple we're going to say row id we want to set this tutorial all of our database variable u

1166,8_108/00015.jpg,we're going to basically return the data so what we're gonna do is we'r,row four and we're going to set up a string and we're going to set this equal to result is going to retur

2005,8_119/00130.jpg,above our on create method called show results and we also need t,up here so for the sdk for the new parentheses and you can add just get our onclicklistener <end
2006,8_119/00131.jpg,two buttons called start and stop all right no no no we need to cal,i've set the get the onclicklistener so we have all of our onclicklistener so i show you guys you want to add tha
2007,8_119/00132.jpg,two buttons called start and stop all right no no no we need to cal,i've set that up here and one send that set the onclicklistener so i show you guys more descriptive so let's go int
2008,8_119/00149.jpg,two buttons called start and stop all right no no no we need to cal,i've set this to add the onclicklistener so we can use a on <end
2009,8_119/00150.jpg,two long's which is start and stop so we ca,call this equal to a <end
2010,8_119/00152.jpg,two long's which is start and stop so we ca,and we can just set up a a a little open bracket right and where our spect and also i show you guy
2011,8_119/00158.jpg,two long's which is start and stop so we ca,worked with those two so let's just down here and such all the top of the onclicklistener set the onclicklistener i just wan
2012,8_119/00160.jpg,with you know a tenth of a second milliseconds milliseconds yea,that so now we can refer to the xml so our text and i hope you want to show you guys thought wher
2013,8_119/00163.jpg,that's what we're working with is milliseconds so start stop and no,so we can do is we have three of the onclicklistener set that up here and we're gonna kind of understand everything tha
2014,8_119/00165.jpg,that's what we're working with is milliseconds so start stop and no,and again this is on something like what's up here and <end
2015,8_119/00167.jpg,just need to kind of set up again a reference for show results which wa,add the on click because we just set up so by id and then we can use it so you can add th

2026,8_119/00196.jpg,to set up our own click listeners for those buttons so we're just gonn,going to return that up so <end
2027,8_119/00197.jpg,to set up our own click listeners for those buttons so we're just gonn,just like 20 times and define that <end
2028,8_119/00198.jpg,button start dot set onclicklistener to this and button stop dot set o,you need to copy paste this again the name for a second so you from being pass those <end
2029,8_119/00199.jpg,button start dot set onclicklistener to this and button stop dot set o,you have a class name for you want to hold for you want to do now again we set it to what we'r

2034,8_119/00212.jpg,right now we're going to go down to our switching case where we where th,text view and then we can read from the tab host and then we just kind of understand here into our text s
2035,8_119/00213.jpg,right now we're going to go down to our switching case where we where th,text from the website and then just open to false and <end

2041,8_131/00025.jpg,current time from the system so again we created a long to handle that an,like okay <end
2042,8_131/00035.jpg,call it start so we're going to say start is equal to and then we'r,say something like this <end
2043,8_131/00036.jpg,call it start so we're going to say start is equal to and then we'r,say our our slider or a slider go into <end

2045,8_131/00041.jpg,to say system 4 into the system class and when we hit dot we can ge,say control so we're gonna do is we're going to quickly so we're gonna do is created one new <end
2046,8_131/00042.jpg,to say system 4 into the system class and when we hit dot we can ge,so then we're gonna do again to it a tent such as position and then we're gonna say not review thread dot clos
2047,8_131/00049.jpg,time in milliseconds right here and so that's what we're going to that',so there we go shared preferences and the second button so whoops right here or not gonna change a private <end
2048,8_131/00050.jpg,time in milliseconds right here and so that's what we're going to that',so there and we're gonna get a load button so we're gonna do is where we're gonna change <end
2049,8_131/00051.jpg,we're going to use pretty simple i mean this right here is the core concep,we're going to have there and it's going to code is just the same way up so we're just going to hold ou
2050,8_131/00052.jpg,we're going to use pretty simple i mean this right here is the core concep,we can read a simple for the most part just make it so again the thing we have four parameters <end
2051,8_131/00053.jpg,we're going to use pretty simple i mean this right here is the core concep,i'm sorry right here and then so there and then the other option three lines of the error because <end
2052,8_131/00059.jpg,this lesson just get you know whether you're working with velocities o,say our our slider or a simple for the most <end
2053,8_131/00060.jpg,events you can you know start the time right when they touch the scree,from the folder and you just click that <end
2054,8_131/00061.jpg,events you can you know start the time right when they touch the scree,all we just want you guys are using the only other thing we need to do is we set up a simple fo
2055,8_131/00062.jpg,release the time right when they release the screen or get another tim,are basically that's kind of all our way <end
2056,8_131/00063.jpg,release other touch event and then you can calculate some kind of velocit,so we're just going to hold our save tab as an edit text for the most <end
2057,8_131/00064.jpg,release other touch event and then you can calculate some kind of velocit,to do is say a a simple for the most <end
2058,8_131/00065.jpg,release other touch event and then you can calculate some kind of velocit,say our our slider class just set this up so there and then just one other thing of <end
2059,8_131/00077.jpg,release other touch event and then you can calculate some kind of velocit,we set it up here and then we're going to <end
2060,8_131/00079.jpg,we're also going to do that within the stop event so we're going to sa,say tab text to the way so just set up you can open up so tab this and then to do is sa
2061,8_131/00080.jpg,we're also going to do that within the stop event so we're going to sa,say our up <end
2062,8_131/00104.jpg,stop variable is equal to again system dot current time and there we go ,say our start activity we need to do is where we're just going to put an nth <end
2063,8_131/00105.jpg,stop variable is equal to again system dot current time and there we go ,over here is just cast it as you have the third one stopwatch and it's called a simple for the most part no
2064,8_131/00115.jpg,stop variable is equal to again system dot current time and there we go ,i'm sorry right here is just a simple little tutorial for the most <end
2065,8_131/00120.jpg,textview so we're going to say was our text you called show resul,we're just going to hold our tab next we just run our way to speak up for this see it's nothing new an
2066,8_131/00121.jpg,textview so we're going to say was our text you called show resul,if our way so again the xml and we're going to set this up to the result <end
2067,8_131/00122.jpg,actually we're going to say because if it's all about problem solving sorr,we're just going to finish one is the way to make it to the way to make it for the most part wher
2068,8_131/00126.jpg,button and they never hit the start button then we're going to get som,say new one is basically that's called right here and so we're just cast it as <end
2069,8_131/00127.jpg,again is just a simple if else or if statement so we're going to say i,i'm sorry right here so we're just going to convert our our slider or a simple way to hold our tab to s
2070,8_131/00130.jpg,again is just a simple if else or if statement so we're going to say i,say our within our second <end
2071,8_131/00134.jpg,again is just a simple if else or if statement so we're going to say i,say new one is make it within our way like <end

2073,8_131/00157.jpg,is not equal zero i don't know and then we're going to print our textvie,here which will make <end
2074,8_131/00159.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,say our milliseconds so we're just going to set up a a slider because that's going to do is we have some sor
2075,8_131/00160.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,i'm sorry right here so i'm just close all in <end
2076,8_131/00161.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,here so we're just going to add our right <end
2077,8_131/00166.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,set up a a string for the most part so first <end
2078,8_131/00167.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,we're gonna do is we're going to show you guys know <end
2079,8_131/00168.jpg,our stop time - our starting time so basically it's going to be how lon,here so i'm just cast it as an input stream so we're just going to do is where we're just going to cod
2080,8_131/00169.jpg,our stop time - our starting time so basically it's going to be how lon,yeah i'm sorry right so we're just going to say new one and then what we're gonna do is is a half th
2081,8_131/00172.jpg,our stop time - our starting time so basically it's going to be how lon,say our first <end
2082,8_131/00173.jpg,our stop time - our starting time so basically it's going to be how lon,here is we're going to do is we're going to do is say so we're going to do is we're going to d
2083,8_131/00174.jpg,took the person to go from start to stop and then we're going to say ou,so i'm sorry right here so i'm sorry right here so you can see it didn't that problem real quickly hopefully when w
2084,8_131/00176.jpg,took the person to go from start to stop and then we're going to say ou,and set this equal to our what we have our save button so we're going to quickly so we're going to quickly s
2085,8_131/00177.jpg,took the person to go from start to stop and then we're going to say ou,so i'm sorry right here so don't know it's going to change one and as well so basically the first variable names t
2086,8_131/00179.jpg,view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show result,so i'm sorry right here so don't know it's kind of a common <end
2087,8_131/00180.jpg,view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show result,so what we're going to show you that but so we're gonna do is within here whereas <end
2088,8_131/00181.jpg,view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show result,so first again we have you know so again we have to do is so we're going to build <end
2089,8_131/00182.jpg,view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show result,an nth <end
2090,8_131/00185.jpg,view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show result,and then we're also going to convert it as an yeah we have some methods you that this yeah i don't know s
2091,8_131/00197.jpg,it dot set text and now we just have to convert this long into a string s,and set up a an nth <end
2092,8_131/00198.jpg,just refer to the long class capital l ong dot and then we say to strin,task dot update entry something like the stuff for the the seconds even with which <end
2093,8_131/00199.jpg,just refer to the long class capital l ong dot and then we say to strin,format and then we're going to create a new the edit text and all we're gonna refer to so we're also gonna firs
2094,8_131/00201.jpg,just refer to the long class capital l ong dot and then we say to strin,task dot update entry or not class and then we want to <end
2095,8_131/00202.jpg,just refer to the long class capital l ong dot and then we say to strin,know long as well and then milliseconds all the new boston and a milliseconds seconds so we're going to do is so firs
2096,8_131/00203.jpg,and we're done i mean basically all we did is we got the current time a,and then we're also going to false and that's right here so basically what we're going to quickly so control yeah we're makin
2097,8_131/00205.jpg,and we're done i mean basically all we did is we got the current time a,so there we go so control yeah we're also going to set up a pretty simple now basically that maybe yeah we're gonn
2098,8_131/00207.jpg,time was not equal to zero oh so kind of forgot the key ste,within here is because that's happening is not so we're going to convert our start activity we have there we go into ou
2099,8_131/00209.jpg,time was not equal to zero oh so kind of forgot the key ste,so we're also going to show you guys in here so now we're gonna do is we're gonna do is we're gonna chang
2100,8_131/00218.jpg,with this is we need to set our starting equal to zero to begin with s,we're also going to set up <end
2101,8_131/00219.jpg,just going to say start equals zero within our on create method so tha,here then just kind of click it's kind of confusing me say <end
2102,8_131/00220.jpg,just going to say start equals zero within our on create method so tha,to do is basically <end
2103,8_131/00221.jpg,just going to say start equals zero within our on create method so tha,here so <end
2104,8_131/00224.jpg,just going to say start equals zero within our on create method so tha,to do is just kind of <end
2105,8_131/00225.jpg,it will kind of problem-solve for us and then let's run the applicatio,text <end
2106,8_131/00226.jpg,sure it works so again this is a millisecond so when we hit let',you can do for the new boss in <end
2107,8_131/00233.jpg,sure it works so again this is a millisecond so when we hit let',tutorial is just save go into our java class we didn't do is just save go into our first thing that we go
2108,8_131/00236.jpg,sure it works so again this is a millisecond so when we hit let',one and we're just going to show you guys we're just going to <end
2109,8_131/00237.jpg,sure it works so again this is a millisecond so when we hit let',this up here and again to do is <end
2110,8_131/00240.jpg,sure it works so again this is a millisecond so when we hit let',you can see here so you can see here so yeah well so that's good <end
2111,8_131/00241.jpg,hit stop is two hundred forty seven one milliseconds which is about tw,this <end
2112,8_131/00242.jpg,one seconds that's lap two fifty fou,our controller and <end
2113,8_125/00018.jpg,in and i know i told you guys we'd render something last tutorial i kin,also going to change this one to width and this one to height so there we <end
2114,8_125/00020.jpg,forgot about it so just uh you know we're gonna get into that i,the language <end
2115,8_125/00021.jpg,stuff so let's just get into it what we're gonna do first within ou,change this one to egl config as well as for this second and we're gonna say public public gl render gets <end
2116,8_125/00025.jpg,create method is type out our gl object that's being passed in we're jus,change this one to egl config we want to set this <end
2117,8_125/00028.jpg,create method is type out our gl object that's being passed in we're jus,frame method or <end
2118,8_125/00029.jpg,say dot gl clear color and this is basically saying hey when you cal,reference the left value we're gonna do is at <end
2119,8_125/00030.jpg,clear command or actually this is basically just like setting th,have a second and we have three methods unimplemented methods and we unlocked our statement <end
2120,8_125/00031.jpg,value for the most part but what what this clear is all about you'r,we just quickly so we do is we just set up we're <end
2121,8_125/00041.jpg,value for the most part but what what this clear is all about you'r,we just quickly so we're just gonna set this float here we have up here and just kind of a little bit we'v
2122,8_125/00044.jpg,like what why is it calling it to clear a color well basically all it',way this tutorials again in <end
2123,8_125/00045.jpg,like what why is it calling it to clear a color well basically all it',we can <end
2124,8_125/00046.jpg,is when you call the clear command you know sending this message it,have our triangle so we set up left value is we're gonna say 1 negative 1 in float we we go <end
2125,8_125/00047.jpg,what's up so what we're gonna do is we're gonna paint our background o,that equal to the gl 10 class is it to disable it not going to be on draw or the gl 10 clas
2126,8_125/00051.jpg,what's up so what we're gonna do is we're gonna paint our background o,that equal to the gl 10 class and just set so a good stuff and <end
2127,8_125/00054.jpg,like 0.8 and we're just gonna say f for float and for green we don't wan,performance and then it's gonna be a little bit more by the camera <end
2128,8_125/00059.jpg,like 0.8 and we're just gonna say f for float and for green we don't wan,object for this second method <end
2129,8_125/00060.jpg,green in there man green just isn't gonna happen in blue what woul,within your constructor equal <end
2130,8_125/00062.jpg,like point to blue so again we can go from 0 to 1 and for alpha we don',change this one to be access this one bottom and again i'm <end
2131,8_125/00089.jpg,it to be transparent but so we're just gonna set t,within your ondraw method this one to probably probably kind of <end
2132,8_125/00090.jpg,again you guys get if you want transparency a little bit you ca,we're gonna set this <end
2133,8_125/00112.jpg,to use this color thing we're gonna do that within our on surface creat,so obviously we set up a renderer class and change this time so we have to do is going to again the constructo
2134,8_125/00115.jpg,for example we're just gonna really again to our gl ten object an,gonna set this up for a private so we're just gonna do is at least to do is define a renderer class an
2135,8_125/00116.jpg,for example we're just gonna really again to our gl ten object an,and then we just <end
2136,8_125/00117.jpg,we're gonna relate to our gl ten clas,so obviously we have three things and we just start painting or egl config as saying this one top of define you kno
2137,8_125/00120.jpg,jill ten we're just gonna say dot gl underscore color buffer bit an,3 and just cw <end
2138,8_125/00121.jpg,jill ten we're just gonna say dot gl underscore color buffer bit an,were creating a gl 10 dot gl underscore col <end
2139,8_125/00122.jpg,jill ten we're just gonna say dot gl underscore color buffer bit an,that gl ten class dot gl c and we're gonna do is gl ten class dot gl underscore vertex array and the g
2140,8_125/00123.jpg,jill ten we're just gonna say dot gl underscore color buffer bit an,ten dot gl underscore bitmap we're going to change a case next tutorial we have all we're gonna do is draw gl do
2141,8_125/00146.jpg,and see what happens and just you guys are gonna have to watch real closel,send yeah see if <end
2142,8_125/00159.jpg,and see what happens and just you guys are gonna have to watch real closel,hit return <end
2143,8_125/00162.jpg,and see what happens and just you guys are gonna have to watch real closel,super bracket of <end
2144,8_125/00163.jpg,well basically what's happening is we call that within our on create metho,have three indexes <end
2145,8_125/00164.jpg,well basically what's happening is we call that within our on create metho,so we're just gonna set this and we're gonna set this <end
2146,8_125/00165.jpg,have this draw frame thing so if we move this clear command down into ou,this is just basically <end
2147,8_125/00166.jpg,have this draw frame thing so if we move this clear command down into ou,anything within our <end
2148,8_125/00167.jpg,you tell me what to do and then that's what we set up within our o,this one as well as for this second points again the gl 10 class and we unlocked our on draw our <end
2149,8_125/00168.jpg,method so again let's run it and as you can see it's just a solid re,triangle again that's the left it tilts it and that ok are you guys go down their phone because <end
2150,8_125/00174.jpg,so what we're gonna do is with them again are on create method we'r,we're gonna set <end
2151,8_125/00180.jpg,gonna say gl relating again to that gl 10 object and we're gonna say do,we're just gonna say gl dot gl matrix <end
2152,8_125/00183.jpg,clear again and this time we're gonna say depth of a float and by defaul,we just say gl gl dot gl dot gl matrix mode face that's the face <end
2153,8_125/00186.jpg,gonna be one that's what we're gonna set to ,we can <end
2154,8_125/00206.jpg,this clear command and how we do that is again i don't know what that symbo,we want it right there we go <end
2155,8_125/00207.jpg,this clear command and how we do that is again i don't know what that symbo,performance and also we have three choices that good stuff so we're just gonna start everything else we need to change this righ
2156,8_125/00211.jpg,above your enter key or your return key so just throw one of those in ther,performance and also do is at one and just set a one to be 0 the gl 10 class dot gl underscore fastes
2157,8_125/00235.jpg,then again we're going to relate to our gl 10 class dot gl underscore dept,paint dot gl back to a constructor we're gonna set it to 0 the pointer down <end
2158,8_125/00237.jpg,then again we're going to relate to our gl 10 class dot gl underscore dept,draw to the gl 10 dot gl underscore color and we're gonna set it up so just the <end
2159,8_125/00238.jpg,then again we're going to relate to our gl 10 class dot gl underscore dept,pointer we're gonna set it up so gl 10 dot gl 10 dot gl underscore color and we're gonna set to initial constructo
2160,8_11/00028.jpg,then again we're going to relate to our gl 10 class dot gl underscore dept,draw and the 10 object or the camera and then we're just gonna set to be 0 the on all we have al
2161,8_11/00029.jpg,then again we're going to relate to our gl 10 class dot gl underscore dept,pointer we're gonna set it to the constructor and just disable argument is the gl 10 object and we're gonna do is we'r

2169,8_11/00044.jpg,we're gonna get into a lot more stuff with surrender so don't worry abou,performance and also we unlocked our canvas so we're just gonna set their method i don't know if <end
2170,8_11/00056.jpg,and i'll catch you guys in the next tutorial have a goo,clockwise because so <end
2171,8_11/00058.jpg,and what we're gonna do in this tutorial we're basically going to se,want to do is say input <end
2172,8_11/00064.jpg,that let's set up some variables that we're going to use and they're gonn,now if it returns a comment just went through <end

2403,8_38/00173.jpg,our touch event of our overlay to our actual map activity or actua,into the on touch method we're gonna get the starting point that's greater than one and the geo on the the event locatio
2404,8_38/00174.jpg,our touch event of our overlay to our actual map activity or actua,latitude and delete that it's greater than one and that's pretty much turn it as well i'm just gonna copy this whole tim

2418,8_38/00224.jpg,get into the geo coder down here we need to set this touch point up so o,get into the on touch method and then what we're gonna refer to <end
2419,8_38/00227.jpg,that and then a delete the type there and paste it above as well so now w,controller object that's gonna be pretty much all those text and we're gonna call this controller is going to be it's gonna typ

2455,8_10/00045.jpg,guys in the next one have a good on,statement and lastly dot get like action <end
2456,8_10/00047.jpg,be set clickable so we're going to use this on click method as you ca,what we're going to show you <end
2457,8_10/00049.jpg,be set clickable so we're going to use this on click method as you ca,going to finish because <end
2458,8_10/00050.jpg,we're setting our set onclicklistener and then basically just so we ca,back to a toggle is so we're going to do the most part then we're going to have a good review but <end
2459,8_10/00051.jpg,this on click method and you know if we had like 20 buttons this would b,going to finish off the statement and this check out it's going to use a little information if <end
2460,8_10/00055.jpg,this on click method and you know if we had like 20 buttons this would b,called input that line is dot next line of code within the toggle is set it to a <end
2461,8_10/00060.jpg,click listener on click method i'm kind of defining what we want to do wit,what we're passing in the things through <end
2462,8_10/00064.jpg,there so what we're going to do is we're going to scroll up to the top o,back up to the statement so <end
2463,8_10/00070.jpg,there so what we're going to do is we're going to scroll up to the top o,to set the gravity to center and we <end
2464,8_10/00077.jpg,we can use some of the methods but what we can also do is we can implemen,what we're going to set that up the xml and so we're going to set this check a little bit about <end
2465,8_10/00079.jpg,class so we're going to say implement and you do that by saying implement,set our onclicklistener set that edit text color and that's what we're going to say create a textview type out our <end
2466,8_10/00080.jpg,class so we're going to say implement and you do that by saying implement,but we're just going to set that up the xml and <end
2467,8_10/00085.jpg,that class so again we're just going to save you dot onclicklistener there w,variable we're going to do that we're going to do that quickly again but that's how to set the gravity is we're gonn
2468,8_10/00087.jpg,that class so again we're just going to save you dot onclicklistener there w,call this ad and we can use i mean if you don't retype it pretty good <end
2469,8_10/00088.jpg,add unimplemented methods we're just going to click that and then i,what i've set the to do is we're gonna talk through setting up and we have all our basic database on click metho
2470,8_10/00092.jpg,add unimplemented methods we're just going to click that and then i,to <end
2471,8_10/00095.jpg,scroll down to our bottom again just kind of like when we set up a metho,bacon and eggs now i just created this error <end
2472,8_10/00096.jpg,the last tutorial it's going to create a new method for us right belo,this is a a hold from the random <end
2473,8_10/00098.jpg,method and it's called on click basically that's the same metho,accessible to the color here and it's private that's a crazy from the last random and let's go into it on all thre
2474,8_10/00103.jpg,method and it's called on click basically that's the same metho,accessible to the color here this method be a final and let's go we <end
2475,8_10/00104.jpg,right here so what we're going to do is we're going to set up a switch i,called input that we set up here to show you guys again it's <end
2476,8_10/00106.jpg,to determine which button has been pressed so again this is just kind o,what final means <end
2477,8_10/00107.jpg,review on the switching case but this is also going to kind of introduce yo,set it equal to <end
2478,8_10/00108.jpg,click method is cold it gives us which view was pressed and again lik,and what this is gonna be called and you can kind of wasn't that variable <end
2479,8_10/00109.jpg,click method is cold it gives us which view was pressed and again lik,and then we're going to do is i is open up <end
2480,8_10/00117.jpg,is v because they label this view that's the data that they're giving u,the on <end
2481,8_10/00133.jpg,example we could also say label view because that's kind of just lik,right here and now our ellen <end
2482,8_10/00135.jpg,variable and then we can reference that variable within these brackets s,onclicklistener because we <end
2483,8_10/00136.jpg,variable and then we can reference that variable within these brackets s,onclicklistener because we <end
2484,8_10/00137.jpg,going to say view and hit dot we're going to say get id and that's goin,and what we're gonna do if the most part <end
2485,8_10/00141.jpg,up set up a bracket and we're going to set up two cases because we hav,onclicklistener just hover <end
2486,8_10/00145.jpg,buttons so we're going to say if the case is our dot id dot butto,and then the series you can see all our <end
2487,8_10/00147.jpg,which was our you know our command button for the most part we're goin,and then we're going to set this <end

2853,8_126/00448.jpg,final x - are starting x and that will giv,dot get x and f y our final y is gonna get x and f y our final x and f y ou
2854,8_126/00452.jpg,the change in the x direction and then we're also going to say dy is equa,actions that will download that real quick up yeah i'm so again be <end
2855,8_126/00453.jpg,the change in the x direction and then we're also going to say dy is equa,get any errors yeah i <end
2856,8_126/00466.jpg,our final y and our - our starting y and let's say you know our screens 40,get any errors you know <end
2857,8_126/00467.jpg,gonna do is we're gonna kind of scale it down so we're just gonna say ou,going to be <end

2865,8_126/00494.jpg,then we're also going to say are scaled y is equal to our d y divided by 3,some variables back equal to again get this on touch method it's gonna do <end
2866,8_126/00496.jpg,there we go we kind of have our scale variables set up now what we'r,just put like sleep we're gonna say case to have our plus our motion event dot get any errors it's gonna get an
2867,8_126/00499.jpg,there we go we kind of have our scale variables set up now what we'r,some variables back to be like down we kind of the easy way to get rid <end

2869,8_126/00511.jpg,want to do is we're going to go into our actual animation and so what we'r,just finish one let's let's actually starts our thread which is called a little bit more thoroughly what we're just gonna say musi
2870,8_126/00512.jpg,want to do is we're going to go into our actual animation and so what we'r,kind of context of this we're gonna say music true so there's also just gonna destroy <end
2871,8_126/00519.jpg,want to do is we're going to go into our actual animation and so what we'r,just finish it's called last state because the default for the most part is gonna skip over here until you know the oncreat

2875,8_126/00536.jpg,test is what we what is what we defined there so we're going to copy tha,starting y and then we're gonna get y minus plus i mean half so if <end
2876,8_126/00537.jpg,test is what we what is what we defined there so we're going to copy tha,and bit done with statement so if <end
2877,8_126/00539.jpg,let's do it below our x or a plus symbol there and there we go now we'r,starting y and our starting this this this to but <end
2878,8_132/00020.jpg,print a ball again just centered everything is pretty much the sam,again we can still get height there so now when we say motion a common motion our starting y and then we're gonn

2885,8_132/00080.jpg,you know this if statement and we're going to change that value and s,release our starting x and then we say get height this <end
2886,8_132/00081.jpg,you know this if statement and we're going to change that value and s,and then we're gonna get height there for again be done this <end
2887,8_132/00083.jpg,you know this if statement and we're going to change that value and s,statements only well so we can use this our if that's not gonna get height this <end
2888,8_132/00085.jpg,you know this if statement and we're going to change that value and s,gonna copy this these process some final y and our starting x here we all our easy way to copy this just cop
2889,8_132/00086.jpg,going to say is we're going to say an eye x equals ni x plus are scaled ,well this to <end
2890,8_132/00089.jpg,going to say is we're going to say an eye x equals ni x plus are scaled ,gonna get height this line here we draw our test let's do this is <end

2901,8_132/00106.jpg,few things that we still need to do and we'll finish up in the next tutoria,well this first xml i'm so that's pretty blue here we created a big deal right here we get any points there <end
2902,8_132/00109.jpg,few things that we still need to do and we'll finish up in the next tutoria,you can just draw our our final y plus bitmap that we did for the x here hit <end
2903,8_132/00110.jpg,we kind of got the basics down very very basic stuff so we're gonna clic,about us a quite a few different things kind of confusing <end
2904,8_132/00119.jpg,data class for the for sending data and then we're going to open up ou,we what we can do in this tutorial is where we're going to call the to have to get those set up ou
2905,8_132/00121.jpg,data class for the for sending data and then we're going to open up ou,that's not going to show you guys are using for the most part so we're going to <end
2906,8_132/00122.jpg,class and what we're going to do is go in with in our on create method an,next tutorial so i'll catch you guys but now we can do is we just have this text in the references to kin
2907,8_132/00128.jpg,could create a method like get data or something and then set it up withi,also want to do is <end
2908,8_132/00129.jpg,well so what we're going to do is basically create a new bundle an,those within you guys again it's going to do so yet so just <end

3203,8_133/00393.jpg,pretty much this tutorial let me talk through everything that we've don,set it to our right <end
3204,8_127/00004.jpg,basically we set up a string called collected this is going to be all o,know it's read some stuff this <end
3205,8_127/00005.jpg,data that we breed we set up a file input stream and both of those ar,going to type of bytes of data and right here so now <end
3206,8_127/00007.jpg,stream and get how many bytes is available and that's gonna set up ,going to type of bytes of you know it's going to set it up a review of bytes of data and right no
3207,8_127/00008.jpg,array which we call data array then while our file put in ou,we're also have to through our <end
3208,8_127/00010.jpg,input stream is reading all of those bytes for the most part and as lon,going to give it a for the most <end
3209,8_127/00012.jpg,input stream is reading all of those bytes for the most part and as lon,going to kind of and <end
3210,8_127/00015.jpg,that's not equal to negative one because when it equals negative one we'r,for this <end
3211,8_127/00017.jpg,it's going to break out of our while loop and while that's happening w,this toast that's gonna be a little bit more we're going to give it our dialogue and what <end
3212,8_127/00026.jpg,gonna basically be whatever is our data that we saved and then we hav,need to give it our dialogue and just close our dialog equals and then we need to do now we need to kin
3213,8_127/00027.jpg,gonna basically be whatever is our data that we saved and then we hav,for the most <end
3214,8_127/00037.jpg,gonna basically be whatever is our data that we saved and then we hav,is gonna be a little bit further you guys is hit this our data is <end
3215,8_127/00038.jpg,catch exceptions for file not found and file our input output exception an,and because again is <end
3216,8_127/00041.jpg,catch exceptions for file not found and file our input output exception an,this need to close it so we're gonna have our load data creates this kind of <end
3217,8_127/00047.jpg,catch exceptions for file not found and file our input output exception an,this <end
3218,8_127/00048.jpg,as well so hopefully you guys kind of understand that it's it's no,return collected and it's going to close our input-output and catch how catch a comment out my trying catch and then we're jus
3219,8_127/00056.jpg,as well so hopefully you guys kind of understand that it's it's no,return collected and three exception and i want to catch as <end
3220,8_127/00057.jpg,as well so hopefully you guys kind of understand that it's it's no,return collected and it's going to get our main class and we do we're going to do is with our paths <end
3221,8_127/00058.jpg,difficult for the most part and also we can do is we can now set ou,happens if everything works properly it's going to actually read so <end
3222,8_127/00063.jpg,which we call data results and then dot set text and then we're gonna set i,and we're going to <end
3223,8_127/00066.jpg,which we call data results and then dot set text and then we're gonna set i,and within <end
3224,8_127/00077.jpg,which we call data results and then dot set text and then we're gonna set i,can just an alpha <end
3225,8_127/00079.jpg,which we call data results and then dot set text and then we're gonna set i,you know right now so now we're getting our and think of an open your text right here and just you know an
3226,8_127/00081.jpg,to this collected string that we read for the most part so now it's goin,you know that's pretty simple and then we just want to kind of just been trying to <end
3227,8_127/00082.jpg,to this collected string that we read for the most part so now it's goin,you know that's read dot sleep <end
3228,8_127/00101.jpg,more complicated for the most part than the shared preferences and if yo,a ton of bytes of data as if i got some stuff so now <end
3229,8_127/00109.jpg,watching guys hopefully it wasn't too confusing and i'll catch you guys i,read any time and go to our load <end
3230,8_127/00110.jpg,watching guys hopefully it wasn't too confusing and i'll catch you guys i,you know read this get kind <end
