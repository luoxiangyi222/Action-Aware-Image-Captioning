1,5266870,"So basically what I would love to do is to be able to build up a list of editable fields using editText boxes. However, instead of going into my XML layout and adding a new editText each time I want to add something to the list, is there a way to do this similarly to building a listView? That is, every time I add to my array of editViews the new editView is ""automatically"" added? So basically, I'm referring to this example for a listView:  In this example, if you simply add to the items in the following XML, you get more list items to appear in your app. Is there a way to do this for editText Views? Or even some other kind of editable widget? Thanks,"
