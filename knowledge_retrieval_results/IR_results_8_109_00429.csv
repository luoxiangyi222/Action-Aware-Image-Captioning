0,3273462,"I have a widget that currently takes a random string from an array and sets it to text view on update. The issue here is that the same item can be re-used multiple times in a row due to the string being 'random' In order to solve this I was going to create a table that held String text, and int viewednum and increment the viewed number each time 'get text' was called. (on update in the widget). My Question: If I put the insert statements in the widget, won't the data be inserted every time 'on update' is called? Would it be better for it to go in the DBadapter class somewhere? I'm just unsure about the best way to make sure I don't enter duplicate data. If there is a better alternative like saving a csv file somewhere and using that I'm open to it, it seemed like a sqlite database was the way to go. Thank you for your time."
0,3763547,"I have a listview and i inflate the first position with a layout and every other position i do
another inflation with another layout.
I can do that by checking every time in getView, but as you can imagine this is not very efficient. Can you share me your thoughts to get that result by having this pattern?
(This don't get me the correct result(cause after 4-5 positions, depending of the number of positions inflated the first time, i get the layout.inside_list_2 on other positions too.)"
0,4211266,"I have a list of about 10 strings that all have different sayings (adages).  How can I go about randomly displaying them for the user to read on an XML? I have a math().random; that generates a random # between 1 and 10.  When that number is hit, I use a simple switch/case that displays a saying to the user in an xml file.  How do I go about displaying that predefined string in the xml? ie: etc.... Thanks!"
0,2445032,I have written a small app that puts my bluetooth in discoverable mode for a long time (G1 - API 1.6). I use that along with small program on windows to lock/unlock the computer if the phone is close by. Recently i try to port this app to my nexus one but it seems like i have to pop up the message every 300s to enable device to go to discoverable mode. does anyone know how i can suppress that? I'm ok with saying ok for the first time but not every 300s :)
0,4136409,"In my app, I have to present a few numbers from a .csv file that's accessible from the web. Now, this .csv is quite big. I don't want to download and process the whole thing, there's no point. My numbers are always in the beginning of the file, in well specified positions - lets say position 5 to 10. Could you give me some tips on how to implement this? I know how to download the whole thing, but don't know how to download only a part of it. Thanks."
