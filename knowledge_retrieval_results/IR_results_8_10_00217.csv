But I have a load of buttons and rather than making a lot of different mapClass classes for each button, I am wondering can I just use the one class and depending on what button 'id' is pressed, it will check an 'if statement' and then put in the correct coordinates into the method to display the map. It would be a lot neater than coding up like 20-30 classes. I'm not sure if i've explained that right so if not let me know. Thanks for any help. This is my map class now... and then my other activity is  For some reason when I try and click on any other item in the list other than BUTTON1 the program crashes.

Thanks."
