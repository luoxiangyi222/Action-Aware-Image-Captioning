I'm wanting to move to developing for Android phones so I'm wondering what suggestions people have for where to go next. Should I jump right to Android? Start with a 'beginning Java' approach? Or should I go some other route to beef up my knowledge of OOP concepts before launching into Android? I have my Dev environment set up and completed the Hello Android tutorial and I'm just wondering if I am going to be in over my head quickly?"
0,4851273,"I've been following a tutorial for working with SQL databases, I think I'm having issues with it because it has been written a while ago.  For example it had this.createDatabase which had to be replaced with this.openOrCreateDatabase, I found this with Google. There are other problems that I cannot find the solutions to: Query, Results, Next, setListAdapter all show errors.  Is this in fact the problem, that the tutorial has been created for an earlier SDK? Can someone please tell me where to go to see deprecated methods and their replacements or point out what I should be replacing the above with?  Apologies I'm just starting out with this, hopefully you understand what I mean. Help is very much appreciated. EDIT:
Tutorial is here:  The problems are in the code below, c.first, results.add, c.next, this.setListAdapter and most of the last line have errors }

0,5077792,"I am trying to learn how to make a quiz to add to my app. I have done extensive searches and found that I will be using SQlite. Which I have seen how a database gets created from a couple of sites. But I was wondering if there was a better tutorial to this. I know that Appinventer has a quiz tutorial but putting blocks together does not show me the code snippets that I am using and therefor in the end I end up learning nothing but putting blocks together.
Anyone have a tutorial on how to do a quiz basic question and answer and give a score at the end? Or is there a way to see the underlying code to a project we build with appinventor? after doing research I decided to go for basics as I get more skills. Here is what my research has yeilded so far. Am I going in the right direction?"

0,5070492,"I am able to display a map for a specific area with the drawable icon showing the exact location. The problem is I don't see any text next to the marker like you do with google maps. It looked like either the title or snippet text you send to the OverlayItem would display but that is not the case. I haven't found any example online that shows how to put some kind of text next to the drawable icon at my location... does anyone have an example ? I originally followed the Google MapView tutorial, but ""Code Magician"" has a much better version of it:
 (Unfortunately without a text label next to the icon on the map)"
