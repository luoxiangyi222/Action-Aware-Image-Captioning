0,2891488,"I have to manage XML documents and Strings in my app. In terms of efficiency and memory usage, will a collection like ArrayList be much more expensive than String[]? Also, I could store the content as a regular String or XML. Is working with XML also more expensive? (When I say expensive, I am referring to the use of system resources.) Those Strings will include xml's.. all i gonna do is pass them to another appz and those appz will deal with them.. nothing more..the ArrayList will hold dynamiclly around 20 Strings each.. and ill will need to 'for each' it, get the content of the string and send it to another app. If there are differences, are they significant? Thanks,
Ray."
0,5265913,"Can someone please tell me how exactly to use getExtra() and putExtra() for intents? Actually I have a string variable, say str, which stores some string data. Now, I want to send this data from one activity to another activity.  and then in the SecondScreen.java I know it is very basic question but unfortunately I am stuck here.
Please help. Thanks, Edit: Here the string which I am trying to pass from one screen to the other is dynamic.
That is I have an editText where I am getting string whatever user types. Then with the help of myEditText.getText().toString() . I am getting the entered value as a string then I have to pass this data."
