I have only been doing java for 2 months and 100% of that has been on Android.  I need some help understanding setting up variables and why I should do it a certain way. Here is an example of my variables list for a class: So all of these are variables that I want to use in all through the whole class. Why would I make something a static, or a final. I understand Public but why make something private? Thanks for your help and please don't be too harsh. I just need some clarification."
1,3511290,I'm doing some maths calculations in android map activity and I need to find a position of a GeoPoint which user has clicked on the map. I understand that I need to use onTouch event handler. This is how it looks like at the moment: It doesn't do what I want though. Any help or hint at least greatly appreciated!
0,2652109,"I've seen example com.example.android.apis.view.List11 from ApiDemos. In that example, each row takes the view android.R.simple_list_item_multiple_choice. Each such view has a TextView and a CheckBox. Now I want each view to have 2 TextViews and 1 CheckBox, somewhat similar to the List3 example. I tried creating a custom layout file row.xml like this: Then in Activity's onCreate(), I do like this:  The result kind of looks like what I want, but it looks like the list doesn't know which item of it is selected. Also, I need to click exactly on the CheckBox. In the List11 example, I only need to click on the item row. So what do I need to do to make a multiple choice list with my custom view for each row? Many thanks."

I noticed in the books I have been reading that the authors have placed a ""dot"" in front of the activity name when registering their activities in the manifest.  I've looked around the Android developer site and I can't figure out why we need the ""dot"".  Does the ""dot"" actually server a purpose? Do I need it?  I have included an example below.  Notice the ""dot"" before ""NewActivity"":"

Or do the AnimationDrawables just not go in the filename.java?   And if I do need to create another class, can you show me how?"
