0,5636799,"I have an input wizard type activity with 2 views and a ViewFlipper. Each view takes up the entire screen and sets it's own title. I combined them because it was a packaged deal, you will never access view2 without first going through view1 and 99% of the time if you access view1, you will access view2. Is this a recommended setup? Is there any cons to using it this way?"
1,3900318,"I have a ViewFlipper that is transitioned between each view, I want to draw animation to a set of canvases, one for each view. How would I go about integrating the canvas into the view  so that I can still have my buttons on top of it for example? If this isn't possible, how would I go about making images drawn to the canvas clickable so i can construct my own buttons?"
0,1066948,"A simple ListView with, say, 6 rows (Views). Now, I want it to fit exactly a single screen. Any straightforward way to do this? Or should I go with a custom view?"
0,4896255,"I have a problem regarding the following:    when I click on the item it shows me the string on first view.but I am not going on to the second view. and also on first view when I click other item still it  shows first  output. i.e. if I select Aries in the first view It shows me aries in the toast window but doesn't go to the second view.
and again I am pressing other item say Taurus, still it shows Aries to me.   "
