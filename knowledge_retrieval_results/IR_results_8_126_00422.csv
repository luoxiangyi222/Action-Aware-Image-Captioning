0,4965724,"I am attempting to build an augmented reality application for Android and have come across the problem of layering surface views. I need a surface view to display the camera preview onto which I will overlay graphics, and I need a surface view to draw my graphics on. This second surface also needs to be drawn above the camera preview but have a transparent background. In my current implementation, I have both surface views working and appearing as they are supposed to, but the background is not transparent and therefore there is no appearance of the second surface view with the graphics drawn being superimposed on the camera preview surface view. How could this be achieved? Upon searching numerous stack overflow questions as well as other forums I've come across many conflicting opinions pertaining to this matter. Some say that layering surface views in Android is impossible whilst others say that it is a matter of using a different layout (FrameLayout vs. LinearLayout?) Specifically, my implementation includes two views: a class, CustomCameraView, that extends SurfaceView, and a class, CustomDrawView, that also extends SurfaceView contained in a FrameLayout with the CustomDrawView appearing after the CustomCameraView. How can these be layered so that CustomDrawView seems superimposed on CustomCameraView?"

and again I am pressing other item say Taurus, still it shows Aries to me.   "
