My app has a countdowntimer and i want the timer to keep running even though the app is in the background. Is there a way to do this without using services ? Because ive been reading up on services and im really notgetting how to use them... and if services is the only way can someone give me a simple tutorial or guide from where i can try this...
I've already seen all the documents and examples on the developer.android.com website... anything apart from those... thankyou "
0,5608094,"this might be an easy question but i have a notification that when clicked open up the stock messaging app but i noticed that every time it is clicked the activity keeps stacking up and i end up having to use the back button a bunch of times to get out of it. I have always used android:noHistory=""true"" in the manifest but obviously i cant do that here so is there a way to do the same thing with when the intent is launched?"
0,5199038,"this is driving me a bit crazy, but the way android lays things out, is you have different directories with the same xml name. so, for example, you might have: res/layout/main.xml, and
res/layout-land/main.xml When you're in landscape mode, it will know to use the one in the layout-land directory. The really irritating thing is that when I'm in Eclipse, and I have res/layout/main.xml file open, and if in the project explorer I click to open the one in layout-land/main.xml, it just leaves the one you already have open (res/layout/main.xml) open.  This is super annoying.  You can get around it by simply closing the one that's open, and then when you click to open the one in layout-land it will open the proper one, but not as long as you already have a file with that name (not same directory) open. Is there any way to fix this other than using a different editor or 'living with it'?"

Now I have some links in that site. 
To see that it is a link I'd like to style the div-element like a button so that one can see that it is a link and clickable. Is it better to use div- or button-elements here?
Are there any information about which way is a better way? In android I had the problem that clickable div-elements were not as sensitive as the button-elements. 
Do you have an idea why? Thanks for your answers. EDIT: I decided to use div-elements though I already worked with buttons. You can find the reasonhere."
