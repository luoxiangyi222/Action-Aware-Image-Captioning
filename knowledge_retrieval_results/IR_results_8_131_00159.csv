My application seems to set the ringer volume when the hardware buttons are pressed. How would I enable the media volume slider?  I would hate for users to have to go into their settings to change the media volume when they use my application."
0,2633769,"I will try to explain a simple app scenario: My app goes right to a 'main view'. In this main view I have inserted a TextView which displays current settings created by way of the PreferenceManager. For simplicity sake, let's say I have a checkbox in my settings. When I first start my app - the TextView on my main view shows my checkbox setting correctly (true). Now I go to the settings menu, it pops-up, and then I change it to false. I go back to the main view and see no change. It still say's true even after I changed it to false. If I end the app and then re-start it - all is well and it shows my change. Apparently the main view just stays in the background while I'm changing settings? How can I redraw or update the main view after I change settings?"
