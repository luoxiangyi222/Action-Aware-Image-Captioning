0,5453158,"I have some code that has got me very close to what Im trying to achieve.  But there are a few issues.  What I want to do is, when a Button is pressed and held, it will continuously call a method AdvanceLog().  The problem is, the ACTION_DOWN motion event does not continue to get called.  What happens is, when you press and hold, the first motion is ACTION_DOWN and every motion thereafter while still holding down is ACTION_MOVE.
This is causing some issues, as I am not REALLY looking for the move action, more so just the repetetive down action.  Any suggestions?"
0,4367961,"For a particular Image say on blue background,  I can get its Width and Height in android. I can display it on screen using ImageView. Even If I keep the background of Image as transparent I can display it on screen. But still if I try to find out the width or height of image programmatically , I still get the same as in previous step. What I wanted to achieve Is there any way through which I can get the exact height or width of image minus transparent background. I want to do this because I 'm trying to implement a drag/move gesture. But now the Image size is more due to transparent background I can only move it to few portion only.  Probably I 'm new to whole game that's why not getting right words to express me. But hope someone will understand.  Thanks      "

0,4633202,"While trying to display a JPG from a URL I'm having an issue getting the image to appear in my ImageView. I'm able to open a URLConnection, pull the image down in an InputStream, decode that stream into Bitmap. I can even get values for the height and width of the bitmap. I set the bitmap to the ImageView and can still get a height for the Drawable. However, the image still does not appear in my application. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Thanks for any help."
