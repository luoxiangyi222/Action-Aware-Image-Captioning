0,4334669,"I'm working on an application which have 5 activities and any of the activity can access other 4.  In one of the activities i have a Finish button that should put my application on background thread. I want to notify my other activities to call finish(), and for that i have two ideas in mind. One is by using intent but other is using interface but i'm little confused to decide on which way should i go?  Are there any other way to notify all activities on same application from an event of one activity? Thanks"

I might use global variables, set them in onStop() for example, but is there any other way?"
0,3411413,"An activity I have starts an AsyncTask. What is the best way of getting the Activity notified that the AsyncTask is done. I can pass the Activity as a Context in, but I don't want the AsyncTask to know about the type of the Activity. In .NET land I would subscribe to an event on the ""AsyncTask"". I didn't find a way to do that in Android."

On the new Honeycomb tablets, however, it seems likely that users will be using the landscape orientation much more often, so I'd like to support both orientations for more of my activities. I'd rather not have to go back and add landscape layouts for the smaller screen sizes (all the way down to QVGA), though, so I'm wondering if there's a way of supporting landscape only for the xlarge screen type but not for the others."
