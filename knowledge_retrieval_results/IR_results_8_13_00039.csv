Here is the situation: I have a query which returns URI strings for ringtones stored in a database. I am trying to add a ""column"" to this cursor with the ringer ""Title"" (since this can change outside my program). I can successfully use RingtoneManager to get the title, but I cannot figure out how to add this ""column"" to the cursor data for later use. Here is what I have so far:"
0,3947641,"In the process of porting an iPhone application over to android, I am looking for the best way to communicate within the app. Intents seem to be the way to go, is this the best (only) option? NSUserDefaults seems much lighter weight than Intents do in both performance and coding. I should also add I have an application subclass for state, but I need to make another activity aware of an event."

0,4611572,"I need to find a way to modify attributes of widgets from within a for loop.  In particular, I need to go through and dynamically change the text on each button in a series.   Changing the text is of no issue, I can do it with a single button very easily, but how can I get this loop to correctly find the next button?  It seems to need to be a direct reference to the button, but there's no way for me to just increment something and get the next button ID. In a worst case scenario I can just take care of every button individually, but this is obviously very sloppy and that's not the kind of code I want to get used to creating, so any help is appreciated."
