0,4878172,"Okay guys, I am developing an app on Android that uses the Google API to display a map on the screen. I have simple overlays that will display the location of Contacts that the user decides to track. I already know how to use the Mapping and retrieve my own location, but I need to know the best way to get other Users locations.  With the release of Google Latitude's API, this functionality was supposed to be made easy. I cannot find any tutorials or anything on how to implement the API.  Please: If you know any Tutorials or anything of the sort to teach me this, please let me know. Also, if this is not the most efficient way to go about this let me know.  Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. Specs: Eclipse Galileo, Android SDK, Android APIs and Google API"

There's something I'm not doing right every single time, so I want to start from scratch. Does anyone know of a simple ""You are here"" type of application. Something that will load Google Maps, and go to the user's location? I have tried the tutorial from the Android API, but it doesn't tell the entire code, and I'm going wrong somewhere. With a fresh tutorial I can solve my problem and learn. Thanks"
