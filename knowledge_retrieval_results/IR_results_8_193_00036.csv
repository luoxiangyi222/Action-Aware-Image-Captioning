I can't do: Basically, I need to be able to kill the last layout the user was shown when he called openCamera() the first time.  Can I finish(); methods in a case or do I have to somehow make this an intent?"
0,2348657,"I am facing a problem I do not know how to solve. I have an activity, when I click on a particular item of the menu linked to this activity, a dialog is displayed and used to add an item. This item has a date and a time, but I do not manage to have a DatePicker and TimePicker within this dialog. I also try passing the activity to the dialog and use this one to display the DatePicker, but that does not work.
Before this, I handled the creation of such items within another Activity. In this case, it works fine. But I found the Dialog sexier... :-)
Would you have any ideas ?
Hope I am not too confused.....
thanks a lot, I edit this post to share the code I have difficulties with. I have a basic Dialog class that tried to use DatePicker and TimePicker. Basically, Eclipse complains that: All this stuff works from within an Activity but I cannot have it working from a Dialog. Thanks a lot, package com.android.myapp;"

1,4329710,"I am trying to have a a progress dialog open when polling my server.  The class is an ActivityGroup because it is nested within a tab bar. To keep the view within the frame, the ActivityGroup is needed.  Here is the declaration of my ActivityGroup class: Now my AsyncTask class is within the same CheckInActivityClass as such: When I run the given app it throughs an error relating to WindowManager$BadTokenException.  Stating the it cannot start the window with an unknown token.  I tried making a sample app that is just a regular Activity(not ActivityGroup) and it worked just fine.  Does anyone know how to modify this to make it work, or a work around that will allow the progress bar to be nested within the tab bar?  Any help is greatly appreciated."
