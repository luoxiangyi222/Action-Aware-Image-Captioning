 I start watching a video in the first Activity, then during playback I start second Activity.
After going back to first Activity I can hear sound but see no picture. My Video Layout: Do you have any ideas why video doesn't appear?"
1,5096829,In one activity I need to start another one but with one condition: if it was started before then it must be finished and started again. This activity show some information about system state (Theme.Dialog style) it also can start some services and so on. As far as I know when I do startActivity(intent) then onResume() will be called (if activity was started before). Does anybody know how to do it?
0,3358523,"i have a default activity that starts first (Activity A), and from there the user can go to another activity (Activity B). In B after some work the user sets a sharedpreference. the next time the app starts i want to check in A if sharedpreference is null to go to B. and i put this if just under  and it encapsulates the whole onCreate. when the app starts it skips A and on B i shows the layout and the FC with NullPointerException. Any one got experience with this? OR any one got a better idea on skipping A?"

1,5038366,"I have three activities in my activity stack, A (main) -> B -> C. A starts B starts C. My C is a dialog box with one button that will take me to A and one button that will take me to B. The Activity B must therefore have history, so if C calls finish() I will always end up in B. Given this, how do I (efficiently) set this up? i.e. how do I (efficiently) go from C to A?"
