0,5458307,"I have two questions. I have an .apk but I don't know anything about the class name or package name. Is there any possibility to find the class name and the package name? If I don't get the class name or the package name of the application, will I be able to launch the application from my current application?"

 Does anyone know what is the full package name for the R class? Oddly enough its not in the import list NOR is it in the com / android / settings package. I want R.array.special_locale_codes for my own needs."

0,2811052,"I'm building a suite of applications, meaning that I have a single set of code that gets customized via a single change of an API key. This means that all of the applications have the same activities, same behaviors, but different icons, package names, and application names depending on the client I am building for. Unfortunately, I haven't figured out a clean way to do this. Because the package name is what the Android Marketplace uses, I've been changing it to com.nilobject.productname.clientname. However, this changes the package for all of the activities to no longer be in the package of the application, since they live in ""com.nilobject.productname."" Additionally, the autogenerated ""R"" moves, so all of the references to R in com.nilobject.productname break. Has anyone else dealt with this problem? I'm using Eclipse for development. Should I just refactor the activities with each build to be in the same package? Is there a system for this that I don't know about? Thanks for any ideas and help!"
0,3507645,"I mistyped the package name when I created my android project, and it took me a while to notice. I used Eclipse's Rename function on the package to change it, and sort out all the references. I've updated the Manifest, and manually checked every file for any references to the old package name. However when I launch the app (it's a live wallpaper) and click settings, I get an IllegalStateException, exactly as if the permissions were not set up correctly (which they are). I've manually uninstalled the app and restarted eclipse. Is there any way out of this? Update: This is an android problem, not an eclipse problem. I created a new project in eclipse, and copied everything over, and when I ran it I got the same error. Further update: I've managed to get it working, I had to set the Activity to export in the manifest."
