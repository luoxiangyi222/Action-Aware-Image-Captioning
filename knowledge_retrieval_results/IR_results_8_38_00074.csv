Is there a quick and easy way to play that wav right when the xml layout is accessed by the user? I have a main class with a bunch of methods, so I can't really place it in onCreate...the layout page is shown based on when the user clicks a button - and it is all in a Linear Layout on a view Flipper Thanks!

I'm trying to follow the model given by the JetBoy demo, so I'm adding a view to the layout which extends SurfaceView.  When this new view is put in my xml layout, I just get a blank screen.   Here's the XML layout if it helps.  The gameview element is what causes the screen to be blank"
0,3774327,"I have 2 ways of displaying ListView data.  I have a class for each type of row.  I do not create the rows in an xml layout.  (Each row is derived from View and does custom drawing). When I switch from 1 type of row to another how do I get the ListView to layout properly with the correct row heights, and refresh? Is View.forceLayout() on the right track? Thanks,
Gerry"

Error inflating class acme.my.MyTextView.   However, I am able to instantiate the view and add it to the main content view manually. The custom View is built from it's own XML layout. How do I get this to work?"
1,3595041,"On my application I'm developing, the main.xml layout (the default layout of my app) has a few buttons that have been assigned onClickListeners (not the implementation way). One of those buttons I want to have the ability to take you to another view. On the other view (preview.xml), there's another button that takes you back to the main.xml view. I've used setContentView in the onClickListeners of those buttons and this works fine so far, but after you click the button that takes you back to main.xml, the buttons on main.xml have lost their onClick functionalities. How can I get this to work right? I presume using setContentView isn't the right way to do this."
