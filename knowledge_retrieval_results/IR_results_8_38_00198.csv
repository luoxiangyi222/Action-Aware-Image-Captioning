Then I found this workaround that people use with some of the functions in this link:  However, that source code there are two calls to: That are the only difference with what I try to do in my code to change vibrate setttings. But Settings.System.VIBRATE_IN_SILENT seems to be removed in 2.2, so when I change vibrate settings ""normal, off, only in silent"", then I go to SO audio settings and vib value is different, and if i go back to my app, vib settings are also different to what i selected before. Any ideas?"

Now I also have a method in the main view that handles flings (swipes between views): Now here is the thing.  On app startup, if I am in the main activity and select settings, it works fine and goes to the Settings activity.  But if I fling over to the Command activity, then fling back to the main activity, then select Settings again, it will call the same method which does this again: But now it automatically shows the Command activity instead of the Settings activity.  I've even debugged and have witnessed it go through the above code and right after startActivity(settingsIntent); it does not go to Settings activity, it goes to command activity.   This is very very strange, as I am TELLING it to go to Settings, but it is not.  It must have something to do with the fling, but I dont see it....?"

Is this true? If so, I'm in a weird situation where my last-known settings are that the user had in fact set the alarm, but the system may have canceled behind my back, so I'm now showing the user the wrong status as to whether the alarm is set or not. Thanks"

I am very nervous now :) I want to set an alarm e.g. to 16:25 to go off, but nothing happens. I have this code: I have also tried this: My final goal is to make it a repeating alarm, e.g. it should go off every day at the set time. Update 01.17.2011. Still not working. I have this code: I have also tried this: and this:"
