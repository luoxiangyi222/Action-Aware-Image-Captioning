sql kind of make sure tutorials that i cut enter but i had starts make me within this will be pretty simple now
i'm i had starts make me at least that a only time with a part as well so i don't know set it
sliding drawer but still pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple now this with a little layout i don't want
because when we can use a part creating a new with a part creating a little bit because it's going to do here
sliding drawer but i know that what's up to come familiar with a part creating a new with a part right now of
because when we do with a layout i cut it pretty simple now when we had it pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple
because i'd pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple now i'm want to gather pretty simple
sliding drawer but i need to know that our application so let's see what we do 10 density now actually let's go into
because case three <end>
because <end>
sliding drawer but still pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple i do sake
sliding drawer but what's up here finish what this with a part right here finish what one with a textview to come on
here have to hit sql layout because when an methods that set it still make guys want to hit enter here have to
click unimplemented methods that have guys have to hit sql layout manager make sure tutorials make me within java here have to hit
click because we had talk over here public layout here public layout here that set it that hit sql initialize here public layout

to size called for what our new new for what this new and to hit new new for what our new for what
to size is for what our new new file to come up here just close and setup everything call this new new new
to size hopefully to and probably side of our new new for <end>
to size laid to size now let's go into finish what our new what our application now let's define what we're going to
to size so our application to code what our application to come new new new what our new what our new what our
define what we're going to size laid <end>
to size now we're gonna hit sd brackets to hit your new new new new what our application now what our new new
define what we're gonna hit sd brackets now hopefully when we go now what our new what our new what our new what
define what <end>
to size now private other xml to hit enter class so basically what's our basic setup here pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple
define what we're going to hit your cursor when when we go to code define what our application to code what we're gonna
we go now anyways because when we go within our sql lite our new application so that's kind of sql lite started here
we go now what it's going to go into go into go to context <end>
we're just public half something new now i'm sorry i'm landscape here we're gonna talk about we go public boolean collected parser now

name make me go into our string because we're also public string name make me within here is go now <end>
name name make me go into our edit text because we go public stuff public string name make me quickly is create here
name make me within here we're just public string name because when an widget name because when we go public stuff public layout
public string name make sure we go into our basic because when we go public class public string name make me within here
public layout name because when we go public object public string because as well so now when we go public string name make
public string because as well so now when we go public string name make me go into our cursor public string because as
public layout name make me within here and now when we had return here we're just public string name make me go into
